##As part of my internship at Codetech Solutions, I was assigned my first task to build a Text Summarization Tool using Python. The objective was to create a program that can automatically summarize a paragraph or article and generate a short, meaningful summary. This task helped me explore one of the most important areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allowed me to gain practical experience in using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.

Being a beginner in the field of NLP, I relied on online learning resources like YouTube tutorials and interactive help from ChatGPT to understand the concepts and logic needed to complete the task successfully. I executed the project using IDLE (Python‚Äôs built-in development environment), which helped me stay focused on the core logic and functionality.

üß† Key Learnings and Implementation:

1. Understanding Text Summarization:

Learned the concept of extractive summarization, where the tool selects the most important sentences from the input text to form the summary.

Understood the importance of word frequency and how scoring sentences based on key terms can result in an effective summary.


2. Tokenization:

Used nltk.sent_tokenize() to split the paragraph into sentences.

Used nltk.word_tokenize() to break each sentence into individual words.


3. Stopwords Removal:

Used nltk.corpus.stopwords to filter out common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù that do not carry significant meaning for summarization.


4. Stemming:

Implemented PorterStemmer from NLTK to convert words to their root forms. For example, ‚Äúrunning‚Äù, ‚Äúruns‚Äù, and ‚Äúran‚Äù were all reduced to ‚Äúrun‚Äù.
